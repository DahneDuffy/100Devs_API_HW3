# 100Devs_API_HW3
NYT Best-seller (basic)

This app allows users to enter a date and genre, and the app will return the NYT Bestseller's List for that given date and genre.


This app makes use of this API: (https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview). 

If you plan on forking this repository, you will need go to the link above and generate your own API KEY, and insert that on line 12 of main.js where it says ${apiKey}.  You may need to delete/comment out the import statement at the top of main.js in order for this to work correctly.
